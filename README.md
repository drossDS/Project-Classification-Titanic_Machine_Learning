# Project-Classification-Titanic_Machine_Learning

Data for passengers on the Titanic is provided and a machine learning classification model is written to predict the survival of a subset of the passengers
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on passenger data to find trends and inform feature engineering
- Employed hypothesis testing validate the statistical significance of engineered features
- Examined the performance of Logistic Regression, K-Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Random Forest Classifier models
- Used GridSearchCV in tandem with ShuffleSplit to optimize models and compare their performance against 30 derived training and validation data sets to increase accuracy while reducing over-fitting
- Created an aggregate classification model which averaged the survival probabilities determined by the previous models to create a new survival prediction for each passenger
